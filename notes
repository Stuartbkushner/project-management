Review as of March 3, 2020
WORKED:

Create new project, but navigation needs help, see below.

Create new grid, Add and Delete rows/columns

For the most part, Groups worked but had some bugs.

BUGS

Had to refresh to see the project – no save indication

Grids are showing in the dashboard like they were different projects, not grids IN A project.

Tiles not showing up in the Pile when making a new grid in the same project.

Grouping does not show group definition and Ungrouping does not work

When I moved a tile off of the pile to a grid – the tile was REMOVED from the Pile. When I press refresh it comes back to the pile.

QUESTION – The grids are showing up as Tabs in the MJ window, not separate browser tabs. What are we going to do?

Big issues that will need sources to test

When using a tile more than once, the source should NOT duplicate

Only one source with all of the tiles, bug is several copies of the source, with only one tile each and no source text.

A tile used more than once only shows the highlighted source text on just the first tile usage, not any of the duplicates.

When a grid has A LOT of tiles, the grid flashes on the screen and then disappears, it takes over a minute for the grid to re-appear.

Remember to move the URL so mosaicjunction.com goes to what we now call home.mosaicjunction.com
